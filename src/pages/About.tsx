          As a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Sydney and an Open Source Software Engineer, 
          I'm passionate about contributing to innovative technology solutions. I'm a maintainer for Meshery, 
          where I help develop and improve cloud native infrastructure management.

          When I'm not coding or researching, you can find me cycling around the beautiful city of Sydney, 
          exploring new trails and enjoying the outdoor lifestyle that Australia has to offer.
